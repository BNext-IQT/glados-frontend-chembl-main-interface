    The table below displays ChEMBL targets which are predicted to interact with
    <span class="BCK-Predictions-MolChemblID"></span>. The target prediction
    returns four classes: ‘active’ or ‘inactive’ depending on whether or not
    <span class="BCK-Predictions-MolChemblID"></span> is
    predicted to interact or not with the target. The value returned can also be 'empty' if the model was not able to
    predict the compound or 'both' if it could not conclude.
    The predictions are given at three different confidence levels. More information on the methodology is available at:
