# Bugs and other issues

Before you create an issue please consider the following checklist:

1. Clear title: `heatmap tooltip doesn't render correctly` is better than `heatmap`. 
Be specific and please avoid using words like: `problem`, `issue` or `something`.

2. Clear description: please make sure you include instructions to reproduce the problem as well as web browser name and version.
If possible upload a screenshot explaining the problem.

3. Labels: Before you submit an issue, please take a look at available labels. 
If you feel your issue fits into a category descibed by one or more labels, please click on relevant labels to see
all the issues assigend to them. It's possible that the similar issue is already created. Once you make sure your issue is 
unique don't forget to assing some relevant labels.

4. Bug or a feature? If you describe a new functionality, please don't use `bug` label, use `enhancement` instead.

5. Closing issues. It may happen that your issue will be marked as duplicate and closed.
If you belive this shouldn't happen, explain it in the comments, we are happy to reopen.
It's still better to submit a duplicate issue than ignore something important!
